# Invoke Conversational AI via API

Here we present how to use Python to interact with Conversational AI via API.

To get started, youâ€™ll need to install the official OpenAI SDK (Software Development Kit) for Python:
```
pip install openai
```
To use Conversational AI tools like [ChatGPT](/LLMs_API/OpenAI.py) or [DeepSeek](/LLMs_API/DeepSeek.py) via their APIs, you need to sign in to their API platform, generate an API key, and ensure your account has sufficient balance.
