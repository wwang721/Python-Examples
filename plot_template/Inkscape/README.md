# How to use Inkscape while keeping fonts in figures generated by Matplotlib

When generating figures in PDF format with Matplotlib using fonts other than the default "DejaVu Sans" (e.g., Times New Roman), importing the PDF into Inkscape may result in incorrect font rendering. If you choose to import the text as paths, the font appearance is preserved, but the text becomes uneditable, meaning you cannot select, edit, copy, or paste it.

Here is a possible solution to address this issue:

* Generate figures in SVG format and embed the fonts by setting `plt.rcParams['svg.fonttype']='none'`. By default, Matplotlib saves text as paths when creating SVG files.

> Note: if you enable TeX for rendering math expression by setting `"text.usetex": True`, all text will be save as paths, overriding the `plt.rcParams['svg.fonttype']='none'` setting.


However, the font for math text remains "DejaVu Sans," which does not match the other text. To resolve this, I change the math text font to something more consistent, such as "Computer Modern (TeX)." Unfortunately, the SVG file may not render correctly if the required fonts are not installed locally. To fix this issue, I download and install the missing fonts, such as "cmr10.ttf," which can be found [here](https://github.com/ClassroomPresenter/CP3/blob/master/Fonts/cmr10.ttf). You can also open the SVG file in a text editor to identify which fonts are missing.


There are still issues with the "Computer Modern (TeX)" font when using expressions like `$\langle x\rangle$` to generate $\langle x\rangle$, the left bracket is missing, and the right bracket appears disproportionately large. To address this, I use `$\left< x\right>$` instead and ***manually*** adjust the font size in the SVG source file as needed.
